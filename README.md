 Given the 5 CSV files which have information about happiness score in different countries, train a regression machine learning model to predict the happiness score. Create the entire EDA/ETL to extract features from the files, train the model using a 70- 30 data split (70% for training - 30% for testing) , stream the transformed data and then in the consumer get the data and use the trained model to predict the happiness score and store in a database the predictions with the respective inputs (features), the entire work is presented in the following figure. Finally extract a performance metric to evaluate the model using the testing data and the predicted data.
